  /**
   * subscribeToTshdEvent lets you add a listener that's going to be called every time a client
   * makes a particular RPC to the tshd events service. The listener receives the request converted
   * to a simple JS object since classes cannot be passed through the context bridge.
   *
   * @param {string} eventName - Name of the event.
   * @param {function} listener - A function that gets called when a client calls the specific
   * event. It accepts an object with two properties:
   *
   * - request is the request payload converted to a simple JS object.
   * - onCancelled is a function which lets you register a callback which will be called when the
   * request gets canceled by the client.
