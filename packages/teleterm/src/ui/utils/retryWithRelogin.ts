/**
 * `retryWithRelogin` executes `actionToRetry`. If `actionToRetry` throws an error, it checks if the
 * error can be resolved by the user logging in, according to metadata returned from the tshd
 * client.
 *
 * If that's the case, it checks if the user is still looking at the relevant UI (the `isUiActive`
 * argument) and if so, it shows a login modal. After the user successfully logs in, it calls
 * `actionToRetry` again.
 *
 * Each place using `retryWithRelogin` must be able to show the error to the user in case the
 * relogin attempt fails. Each place should also offer the user a way to manually retry the action
 * which results in a call to the tshd client.
 *
 * `retryWithRelogin` should wrap calls to the tshd client as tightly as possible. At the moment, it
 * means `actionToRetry` will usually involve calls to `ClustersService`, which so far is the only
 * place that has access to the tshd client.
 *
 * @param resourceUri - The URI used to extract the root cluster URI. That's how we determine the
 * cluster the login modal should use and whether the workspace of that resource is still active.
